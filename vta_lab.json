After that a brief description of what this lab will cover so you know what to expect.\n\n## Intrusion Detection System\n\nIntrusion Detection System (here on out IDS) is a solution designed to monitor network traffic to discover anomalous behaviour. An IDS solution works by receiving a copy of  the infrastructures network traffic and matching network packet header and/or content against signatures.\n\n## Intrusion Prevention System\n\nIntrusion Prevention System (here on out IPS) is usually a specific configuration of an IDS where the device or software is placed inline i.e. configured in a way where the traffic actually passes through the device, giving the additional ability of blocking traffic that matches a signature.",

On high traffic networks however, building from source with custom options and utilising other capture library's can yield significant performance gains. More advanced install modes are not covered in this lab.\n\n## Install\n\nAll the next steps are done on the IDS machine, so before you begin. `ssh ids` \n\n```bash\n# Add the Suricata PPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable\n# Refresh package lists\nsudo apt-get update\n# Install suricata\nsudo apt-get install suricata\n```\n\nAs you can see, the PPA makes installation a breeze.

This means that the IDS machine has to forward all packets coming through it and while forwarding also let Suricata analyse them. For this to work we also have to configure iptables.\nWhen not running inline, you only have to configure the interface receiving the traffic into promiscuous mode and tell Suricata to listen on that interface via the configuration options.\n\n## Ensure Suricata has NFQ support\n\nFor inline operation using iptables, Suricata needs support for NFQ. The PPA binaries already come with this enabled, but to verify you can use the following command:\n\n```\nsuricata --build-info\n```\n\n## Setting up iptables and NFQUEUE\n\nFirst let's make sure, that the nfqueue module is loaded:\n```\nmodprobe nfnetlink_queue\n# To verify\nlsmod | grep nfnetlink_queue\n```\n\nThe easiest method when forwarding traffic, is to add the following iptables rule:\n\n```\nsudo iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE\n```\n\n## Configure Suricata options\n\n1. Open `/etc/default/suricata` and change the `LISTENMODE` option to `nfqueue`.\n1. Open `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` in a text editor of your choice and configure the following options:\n   - In the very beginning under `address-groups` configure the `HOME_NET` parameter. This should be your local subnet i.e. the subnet that has the web server in it.\n1. Run `systemctl restart suricata` to reload the configuration changes.\n1. Review the suricata logs in `/var/log/suricata/suricata.log` to make sure that everything is working correctly.",

			"description": "Now that we have Suricata up and running, it's time to start writing rules.\n\nAn example of a Suricata rule:\n\n![Example rule](https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/attachments/download/440/intro_sig.png)\n\n## The three parts of a rule\n\n### Action\n\nWhat to do when a signature matches. There are four options:\n- pass - When a packet matches a signature, stop scanning the packet and for the current packet skip to the end of the rules\n- drop - If a signature matches, drop the packet. Only for IPS/inline mode. Will also log an alert. On the other hand will cause timeouts, because the other end will get no feedback.\n - reject - Reject the packet by sending either a tcp reset or icmp error packet. Also generate and alert and in IPS/inline mode the packet will also be dropped\n - alert - If a signature matches the packet, generate an alert.\n\n### Header\n\nSpecifys what kind of traffic to match the rule-options against. This has multiple options. Whenever possible try to specify one of the application layer protocols. This reduces the amount of matching that the engine has to do.\n\n#### Protocol\nHas 4 main options:\n- tcp - Any TCP traffic\n-  udp - Any UDP traffic\n- icmp - Any ICMP traffic\n- ip - Any traffic i.e. all of the above\n\nIn addition to these, Suricata also supports some application layer protocols:\n- http\n- ftp\n- tls (this includes ssl)\n- smb \n- dns\n\n#### Source and destination\nHere you can specify IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (both single addresses and CIDR matches are supported) that the traffic should match. You can also use variables like $HOME_NET that can be specified in the suricata.yaml configuration file. Negation matches with \"!\" and grouping matches with \"[]\" are also supported.\n\n**Examples:**\n- !192.168.1.1/24 - any address that does not belong to this subnet\n- [10.10.10.0/24, !10.10.10.45] - any address in the 10.10.10.0/24 subnet except for 10.10.10.45\n- $HOME_NET - Range or ranges that you defined in the suricata.yaml configuration file \n\n#### Ports\n\nWhat ports the traffic is using. For HTTP it's common to set the source port as any and destination port as 80 for example.\nDifferent modifiers are also supported:\n- ! - exception/negation\n- : - range\n- [] - signs to make clear which parts belong together\n- , - separation\n\n#### Direction\n\nWhich way the traffic has to flow. Almost all rules have an arrow to the right, indicating that only packets with the same direction can match.\nExamples:\n- source -> destination\n- source <> destination  (both directions) \n\n**NB! `<-` this kind of direction is not supported.**\n\n### Rule-options\n\nWhen creating a rule, the two options that should always be present are **sid** and **msg** fields\nThese are specified as key:value pairs. Each pair should end with a \";\". Like this:\n\n```\nsid:2008124;\n```\nThe keywords are enclosed inside parenthesis.\n\nThese options can generally be split into four categories:\n- meta-information.\n-headers\n- payloads\n- flows\n\nYou can refer to the material link attached to this objective for a more in depth look at all the options available.",

Use the explanation given in the previous step as a guide to create the rule.\n\nThings to note:\n- Make use of the `$HOME_NET` and `EXTERNAL_NET` variables\n- Use any for the port definitions, since the icmp protocol does not really use ports.\n- Make sure to include a `msg` field. The msg field should describe the traffic.\n- Include a SID number from the correct range of 1000000-1999999.
